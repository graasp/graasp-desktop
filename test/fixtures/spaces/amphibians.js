      '<p>Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this.</p>',

              '<p>The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.</p><p>The earliest amphibians evolved in the Devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the Carboniferous and Permian periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass Lissamphibia.<br>The three modern orders of amphibians are Anura (the frogs and toads), Urodela (the salamanders), and Apoda (the caecilians). The number of known amphibian species is approximately 8,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs. The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from New Guinea (Paedophryne amauensis) with a length of just 7.7 mm (0.30 in). The largest living amphibian is the 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) South China giant salamander (Andrias sligoi), but this is dwarfed by the extinct 9 m (30 ft) Prionosuchus from the middle Permian of Brazil. The study of amphibians is called batrachology, while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology.</p>',

              '▶ SUBSCRIBE HAPPY LEARNING! http://bit.ly/HappyLearningTV\nEducational Videos and songs for Kids. Today we’re going to learn about amphibians!\n\nHello everybody! Today we’re going to look at a truly amazing group of vertebrates... When they’re born they usually live in water... but when they grow up and become adults they spend most of their time on land. We present - the Amphibians!\n All amphibians have some common characteristics that you should know about so you can recognize and differentiate them.\nAmphibians have thin, bare skin, with no hairs and scales to protect them. Most have four legs and a membrane between their toes that allows them to move much better in the water.\nAmphibians are oviparous, but they don’t incubate their eggs after laying them... they abandon them and don’t care for their young. Not very good parents, huh?\nWhen they hatch, they’re small larvae and live in water. Slowly... very slowly... their bodies go through a process called metamorphosis. \nDuring this process, the body of the amphibian... changes... their front and rear legs, their limbs, grow... and their heads and their bodies develop, so they finally look like their parents.\nIn the early stages of their lives... amphibians breathe through gills, but when they grow up and become adults... they breathe with their lungs. The problem is, their lungs are very small, and cannot get all the oxygen they need to live. But nature is very clever... and has solved this problem by allowing them to breathe and get the oxygen they need... through their skin.  That’s why they need to be near water - to keep their skin wet.\nIn the early stages of their life, some amphibians are herbivores, but when they grow up... most become carnivores. So they need to hunt... \nSome have a long, sticky tongue they shoot out to capture prey.\nAren’t amphibians fascinating?  And also a bit strange?!\nSo let’s remember the most important characteristics...\nAmphibians are vertebrates; they’re oviparous; in the early stages of their life they live in water as larvae, but slowly they change until they look just like their parents. This process of change is called metamorphosis.\nAmphibians are carnivores, so they have to hunt to eat; they have thin, smooth skin, and breathe through their skin and with their lungs.\nAmphibians are so interesting, aren’t they? \nGoodbye for now everyone, and don’t forget to subscribe to Happy Learning!\n \n▶SUBSCRIBE TO HAPPY LEARNING! http://bit.ly/HappyLearningTV\n"Educational Videos and songs for Kids"',

They generally have a short body, webbed fingers and toes, bulging eyes, and no tail. Frogs are good jumpers with long powerful legs. Toads are a type of frog. Two species of frogs are the American bullfrog and the poison dart frog.<br><strong>Salamanders </strong>- Salamanders look a bit like lizards. They have skinny bodies, short legs, and long tails. Salamanders can re-grow lost limbs and other body parts. They like wet, moist areas like wetlands. A newt is a type of salamander.<br><strong>Caecilians </strong>- Caecilians are amphibians that don't have legs or arms. They look a lot like snakes or worms. Some of them can be long and reach lengths of over 4 feet. They have a strong skull and a pointed nose to help them burrow through dirt and mud.</p>",
